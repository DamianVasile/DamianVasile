ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DamianWasTaken

I'm a Brunel University Computer science Artificial intelligence Graduate with a MSc in Artificial Intelligence

Context:

This Git doesn't have commits/pushes prior to September 2021, as I've created this github to specifically show employers my current skills whilst on my job hunt

I plan to submit bits and pices of code that I'll be developing on my own in my free time
Whilst I do have projects priorly built during my BSc and MSc, all projects that will be pushed onto this Git are going to be built in the present so that employers have an 
accurate understanding of my capabilities.

Languedges known at the moment:

Java - Advanced
Python - Medium
R Studio - Advanced
C# - Medium
